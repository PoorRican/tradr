Welcome to "tradr," an automated asset trading system designed to maximize profitability for the user with little to no input required. Designed to be a hands-off system, it is able to handle trades night and day without the need for constant monitoring. However, user control is still possible if desired.

Currently, only cryptocurrency trades on the Gemini platform are possible, but the system is easily adaptable to handle any stock symbol or currency. One of the key features is the ability to minimize risk while still maximizing profitability. The system avoids trades during strong, long-term sell or buy signals, ensuring that the user is not caught in unfavorable market conditions. Additionally, trading strategies come prepackaged that can be customized by the user to suit their specific needs and preferences.

In the future, there are plans to implement the ability to shift capital between assets, depending on user preference and profitability.

The system is intended to be run in the cloud, and a docker container will be available soon for even easier use. Whether you are a seasoned trader or just starting out, this ware has the automation and customizable features to reap profit.
