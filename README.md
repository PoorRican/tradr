Welcome to "Tradr," an automated asset trading system designed to maximize profitability for the user with little to no input required. "Tradr" is designed to be a hands-off system, able to handle trades night and day without the need for constant monitoring. However, user control is still possible if desired.

Currently, "Tradr" specializes in cryptocurrency trades on the Gemini platform, but it is easily adaptable to handle any stock symbol or currency. One of the key features of "Tradr" is its ability to minimize risk while still maximizing profitability. The system avoids trades during strong, long-term sell or buy signals, ensuring that the user is not caught in unfavorable market conditions. Additionally, "Tradr" comes prepackaged with trading strategies that can be customized by the user to suit their specific needs and preferences.

In the future, "Tradr" plans to implement the ability to shift capital between assets, depending on user preference and profitability. This added layer of customization and flexibility makes "Tradr" an even more powerful tool for traders.

"Tradr" is intended to be run in the cloud, and a docker container will be available soon for even easier use. Whether you are a seasoned trader or just starting out, "Tradr" has the automation and customizable features to meet your needs and help you reap profits.
